## Marinade Recipe

**Ingredients (for a 17 lb brisket)**

- 1 cup beef stock (low-sodium preferred)  
- ½ cup Worcestershire sauce  
- ½ cup low-sodium soy sauce  
- ¼ cup apple cider vinegar  
- ¼ cup olive oil  
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar  
- 2 tablespoons kosher salt  
- 2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper  
- 2 tablespoons onion powder  
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder  
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika (optional, for extra smokiness)

**Instructions**

1. **Combine the marinade**  
   - In a large mixing bowl, whisk (or blend) all ingredients until fully combined.

2. **Marinate the brisket**  
   - Place the brisket in a large sealable bag or a non-reactive container.  
   - Pour the marinade over the brisket, ensuring all surfaces are well-coated.  
   - Refrigerate for **12–24 hours**, flipping the brisket at least once to ensure even coverage.

## Preparing the Brisket

1. **Trim (optional)**  
   - Some pitmasters trim excess fat down to about ¼ inch on the “fat cap.”  
   - Remove any silver skin or large pieces of hard fat if you prefer.

2. **Remove from marinade & pat dry**  
   - Discard the excess marinade (or boil it if you plan to use it for basting).  
   - Pat the brisket dry with paper towels to help the rub adhere.

3. **Season / Rub (optional)**  
   - You can apply a binder like mustard or hot sauce to help the rub stick.  
   - Consider a simple rub of:
     - 2 parts kosher salt  
     - 2 parts coarsely ground black pepper  
     - 1 part smoked paprika  
     - 1 part garlic powder  
     - 1 part onion powder  
     - 1 part chili powder (optional, for heat)

## Smoking Method on a Pit Boss / “Pitbull” Pellet Smoker

1. **Preheat the smoker**  
   - Set to **225°F (≈107°C)**.  
   - Load the hopper with pellets (hickory, oak, or mesquite are great for brisket).

2. **Place the brisket on the smoker**  
   - Position it fat-cap up or down (your preference; pitmasters differ on this).  
   - Close the lid to maintain a steady temperature.

3. **Initial Smoke Phase**  
   - Smoke the brisket for about **5–6 hours**, or until its internal temperature reaches **160–165°F (71–74°C)**.  
   - Spritz or mop every hour or two with apple juice, cider vinegar, or **boiled** leftover marinade (to ensure safety).

4. **Wrap (Texas Crutch)**  
   - Once the brisket hits **160–165°F**, wrap it in:
     - **Butcher paper** for a more pronounced bark, or  
     - **Heavy-duty foil** to retain more moisture (but might soften the bark).  

5. **Continue smoking**  
   - Put the wrapped brisket back in the smoker.  
   - Aim for an internal temperature of **195–203°F (90–95°C)**.  
   - This second phase may take another **4–6+ hours**, depending on your smoker and the brisket size.

6. **Check for doneness**  
   - Besides temperature, use a probe or skewer to check if it glides in with minimal resistance (“like butter”).  
   - Once it’s tender, remove it from the smoker.

7. **Rest**  
   - Let the brisket rest for **1–2 hours** to redistribute its juices.  
   - Keep it wrapped and place in an insulated cooler or on a countertop loosely covered with foil.

8. **Slice and serve**  
   - Slice against the grain.  
   - Note that a packer brisket has two muscles (flat and point) with different grain directions, so adjust accordingly.  
   - Serve with your favorite sides or use leftovers in tacos, sandwiches, or chili.
