**Savory Herb and Spice Rub for Smoked Turkey

##### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon dried sage
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for a slight kick)

Here's how to apply the rub effectively:

    Pat the turkey dry: After brining and marinating, use paper towels to thoroughly pat the turkey dry, both inside and out. This step is crucial for helping the rub stick and promoting crispy skin4
    .
    Apply a thin layer of oil or melted butter: Use olive oil spray or brush melted butter all over the turkey's surface. This will act as a "glue" for your rub1
    4
    .
    Apply the rub: Generously distribute your prepared rub all over the turkey, making sure to cover both the top and bottom. Don't forget to season the cavity as well3
    4
    .
    Get under the skin: For maximum flavor, gently separate the skin from the meat (especially on the breast and legs) without tearing it. Apply some of the rub directly to the meat under the skin5
    .
    Let it rest: If time allows, let the seasoned turkey sit in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to an hour before smoking. This will give the rub time to adhere better and start infusing flavor into the meat5
    .

By following these steps, you'll ensure that your carefully prepared rub stays on the turkey during the smoking process, resulting in a flavorful and beautifully seasoned bird. The combination of brining, marinating, and this rub application method should produce an exceptionally juicy and tasty smoked turkey

##### Instructions

1. In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients.
2. Mix thoroughly, using a fork to break up any clumps, especially in the brown sugar.
3. Store in an airtight container until ready to use.

If you want to enhance the flavor, you can add aromatics such as dried herbs and garlic to the brine mixture. Stir them in after dissolving the salt and sugar.
	
##### 	Cool the Brine
Allow the brine to cool completely before using it. You can speed up this process by adding ice or cold water.
	
##### 	Brine the Turkey
Place your thawed turkey in a large brining bag, a cooler, or a food-safe container.
	Pour the cooled brine over the turkey, ensuring it is fully submerged. If necessary, add additional cold water to cover the turkey completely.
	Seal the bag or cover the container and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. If using a cooler, you may need to add ice to keep it cold.
	
##### 	After Brining
Once brining is complete, remove the turkey from the brine and discard the brine.
	Rinse the turkey under cold water to remove excess salt from the surface, then pat it dry with paper towels.
	
### Mushroom Broth
Ingredients
- **1 pound fresh mushrooms** (cremini and shiitake), sliced
- **1 large onion**, quartered
- **2-3 carrots**, chopped
- **2-3 celery stalks**, chopped
- **4 cloves garlic**, smashed
- **10 cups water**
- **2-3 bay leaves**
- **1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns**
- **1 teaspoon dried thyme** (or a few sprigs of fresh thyme)
- **Salt to taste**

#### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Vegetables**: Clean and slice the mushrooms. Quarter the onion, chop the carrots and celery, and smash the garlic cloves.

2. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large stockpot, combine the sliced mushrooms, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, thyme, and water.

3. **Simmer**: Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer uncovered for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. The longer you simmer, the more flavor will develop.

4. **Strain the Broth**: After simmering, remove the pot from heat. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into another pot or bowl to remove the solids.

5. **Season**: Taste the broth and add salt as needed. Allow it to cool before using or storing.

6. **Storage**: You can store the mushroom broth in airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze it for longer storage.

##### Usage Tips
- Use this mushroom broth as a base for marinades by mixing it with other ingredients like soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce.
- It can also be used to baste your turkey while smoking to keep it moist and flavorful.
- The broth can enhance sauces and gravies made from your smoked turkey drippings.

### Marinade
#### Prepare the Injection Marinade
	1 cup mushroom broth
		½ cup melted butter
		2 tablespoons lemon juice
		1 teaspoon salt
		½ teaspoon black pepper
		1 teaspoon onion powder
		1 teaspoon garlic powder
		2 tablespoons honey

##### 	Preparation 
Melt the butter and combine it with the liquid ingredients in a saucepan. Whisk in the dry ingredients until well mixed.

##### Injection Guidelines

	•	Inject 12-36 hours before smoking
	•	Use about 1/2 ounce of marinade per pound of turkey
	•	Inject into multiple areas: breasts, thighs, and wings
	•	Inject at different angles to distribute marinade evenly
	•	Avoid injecting near bones
	
##### Tips

	•	Use a meat injector with a large needle
	•	Pat turkey dry after injecting
	•	Allow turkey to sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours after injection before smoking

## Smoking
	
### Seasoning
	•	Rub the exterior with olive oil or melted butter.
	•	Season generously with a mixture of spices (paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper) and stuff the cavity with aromatics like quartered apples, onions, and lemons for added flavor.

### Smoking Process

#### 	Preheat the Smoker
 Set your smoker to a consistent temperature between 225°F to 275°F. The lower temperature will yield a smokier flavor while the higher temperature will cook faster.

#### 	Cooking Time
	•	At 225°F, plan for approximately 30-40 minutes per pound, which means your turkey will take about 7-10 hours.

####    Monitor Internal Temperature 
Use a meat thermometer to check that the thickest part of the breast reaches at least 165°F, and thighs should reach about 170°F.

#### 	Basting (Optional) 
If you choose not to brine, baste the turkey every 30-45 minutes with chicken broth or melted butter to keep it moist.

#### 	Wrapping (Optional) 
To retain moisture during cooking, consider wrapping the turkey in foil after a few hours of smoking; uncover it in the last hour to allow the skin to crisp up.
